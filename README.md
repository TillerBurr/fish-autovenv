## Install
Installation with [Oh My Fish][omf]:

    omf install autovenv

## Usage
Upon entering a directory that contains a Python venv the plugin will automatically activate it for you.
Likewise, when leaving a venv directory the plugin will automatically deactivate it for you. The plugin
also handles cases where you move directly from one venv directory to another.

The only settings are stored in two variables called `autovenv_enable` and `autovenv_announce`.

    set -U autovenv_enable 1|0
Enables/disables autovenv functionality.

    set -U autovenv_announce 1|0
Controls whether or not a message is printed when entering/leaving/changing venvs.
