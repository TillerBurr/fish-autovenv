## Install
Installation with [Oh My Fish][omf]:

    omf install autovenv

## Usage
Upon entering a directory that contains a Python venv the plugin will automatically activate it for you.
Likewise, when leaving a venv directory the plugin will automatically deactivate it for you. The plugin
also handles cases where you move directly from one venv directory to another.

The only setting is a variable called `autovenv_announce` that controls whether or not a message is printed
when entering/leaving/changing venvs.

    set -U autovenv_announce 1|0
